## Stripped dependancies
Creating a new DK is done with `new Dropkick( HTMLSelectElement )`.

As you can see from `test.html` using any library is a breeze!

## Stuff to do
There's still a little bit to do before this is finished. Such as touching up some functions and squashing some bugs. I also need to document all of the new, awesome, methods I've added.

# Suggestions or Bugs? 
If you have suggestions please edit this readme or comment on it saying what you'd like to see!
Search for bugs ruthelessly and call any vermin to our attention!
