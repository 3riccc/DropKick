=
Creating custom dropdowns is usually a tedious process that requires a ton of extra setup time. Oftentimes lacking conveniences that native dropdowns have such as keyboard navigation. DropKick removes the tedium and lets you focus on making s@#t look good.

Requirements:
-
DropKick requires the latest version of jQuery, available at jQuery.com. Other than jQuery, you should include scrollability.js if you want to enable scrolling on iOS devices (you do).

How it works:
-
DropKick works by transforming your existing, boring <select> into beautiful, customizable HTML dropdowns. The name attribute is the only one that is required. You should also set a tabindex attribute to enable navigation via tabbing.

Features:
-
* *Keyboard Navigation:*
   Keyboard navigation in DropKick is very similar to native `<select>` navigation.
   While highlighted, pressing enter, up, or down on your keyboard will open the dropdown.
   While opened, pressing up or down will navigate through the options, and pressing enter will select the currently highlighted option.

* *Themeing:* 
  DropKick was made to be easily theme-able and supports dynamic theme changing.

* *Custom Callbacks:*

How to use:
