Version 2.0
===========

## Stripped dependancies

Creating a new DK is done with `new Dropkick( HTMLSelectElement )`.

## Using the jQuery plugin

As you can see from *dropkick.jquery.js* using any library is a breeze!

1. Import `dropkick.jquery.js` on the page along with `dropkick.js`
2. Do ya thang! `$(".something").dropkick()`
